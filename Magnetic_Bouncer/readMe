This is the software, for the Magnetic Bouncer - published 
in The MagPi No. 69 May 2018

Using two stacks of repelling ring magnets, the position of each stack is sensed by a hall effect sensor. The movement is used to draw or make an Executive Toy desk LED sculpture to fiddle with while mulling over a difficult problem.
