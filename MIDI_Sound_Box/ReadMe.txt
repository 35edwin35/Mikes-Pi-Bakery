These are the files and software for the MIDI sound Box, from The MagPi 63 - November 2017

In Software -> Other_Software there are two codes for the Arduino based alternatives to allow direct connection to the Pi without a USB / MIDI interface.
These are:- feather_MIDI - for using a Feather CPU module
and :- MIDIUSB_soundBox for using a Bare Conductive Touch Board.
