Danse Macabre or Skeleton Dance is a project in the MagPi Magazine No.50 October 2016. It uses the spectrum board from The MagPi No. 46 June 2016, to make one to three skeletons dance to music.

There are several versions of the software, including some early image tests, and one using manual joystick control from The Mag Pi No.49 September.
There is dance.py - the listing published in the magazine and switch_dance.p a version that uses keyboard keys to switch the number of skeletons being displayed.
