Alignment process

Put the 406 by 615 pixel, jpeg card images into the Alignment_folder, to simplify the code there is already a card0.jpeg image in this folder.
If you do not have 10 images change the value in the alignment software
numberOfCards = 10
to an appropriate number

Run the aligment.py software

The image will be shown with the head / body line, and the body / legs line as well as a centre line. When the images are saved these lines will mot be present.

Use the cursor keys to align the head and legs position and also to centralise the picture
Press the s key to save the aligned jpeg image into the Aligned folder.
use the f and b keys to move forward to the next image or back to the previous one.

Once the images have been aligned then transfer them to a graphics program to give them a transparent background and then save them as R1.png, R2.png etc. Finally transfer them to the "cards" folder in the same directory level as the mixUp.py program.
