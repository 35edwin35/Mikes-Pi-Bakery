These are the files and software for the mixed up robots RFID card game, from The MagPi 47 - July 2016
IMPORTANT
You need to change the lines

tokens = [0,0x96e2acd5,0xaa01a910,0xbd51192b,0xccb419de, 0xec9f19de,
          0x5c6ccadd, 0x1c0201de, 0xcc0101de,0x1c88fadd, 0xccba19de]
to match the numbers on the token IDs read from the card to the ones you actually have.

Also included here is an program to align images. See the Read_Me file in this folder for instructions on the alignment process.

In addition to the published program there is also an Exhibition version which handles 20 cards, ten being original sketches and ten being coloured. There is also a sound associated with each Robot card and the display blanks after 25 seconds of no activity. To change this time change this line:-
restartInterval = 25.0

The Robots were designed and drawn by Adam Farrer, read his excellent non fiction short stories here:- http://www.theunsmokedpipe.co.uk/ 

Then they had the low skill task of being coloured in by Mike Cook. Both original and coloured versions are here. We would encourage you to create your own versions by colouring them in yourself.

The "Cards for printing" files are for you to print out, cut out and stick onto the RFID cards.
