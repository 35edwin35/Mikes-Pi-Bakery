Mulder Scripting notes

For a description of Mulder please see The MagPI No 38 October 2015

Mulder Script allows full control of Mulder by a pre defined script
The script is a text file and can run as a one off or set to repeat. 
 
Each line including any comma separated variables defines a single command.
Any number of commands can be set up and they will all execute together on the 'go' command.
Scripts that do not contain a 'quit' will loop, on the start of each loop debug will be set to off.
A small blank window will open when a script is running, while this has the focus clicking the X box or pressing Esc will terminate the program. Mulder shuts down by going to the default position before the program terminates.

On termination Mulder will return to its default starting position.

There is some checking on parameters and non existent commands so hopefully preventing a program crash, but it might be fooled by some scripting errors and could result in a program crash.  

Mulder will respond to the following commands:-

MOVEMENT
move left eye, n
move right eye, n
neck, n
jaw, [state] - where state is either open or closed
where n is a number constrained in software to be within physical limits of the model.

LIGHTS
left eye, n1, n2, n3
right eye, n1, n2, n3
nose, n1, n2, n3
cranium , L1, L2, L3
fade steps, f  - the number of steps to make in a fade, f is a floating point number, the default is 40.0

where n1 = red, n2 = green, n3 = blue, Lx = white LED value
all numbers are between 0 and 4095 - wrapped round by software

SOUND
sound, n   - Where n is the number of the sound sample
background - Runs the file sounds/thunderLong.wav as a background sound on a continuous loop
backgroundOff - Fades down the background sound to off over two seconds

OTHER
debug    - toggles debug mode causes script command lines to be printed
quit     - ends the program
#,       - comment line
go       - executes actions set up and returns when done
delay, f - delays in seconds given by floating point value f
