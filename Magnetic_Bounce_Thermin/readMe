This is the software, for the Magnetic Bounce Theremin - published 
in The MagPi No. 70 June 2018

Using two stacks of repelling ring magnets, the position of each stack is sensed by a hall effect sensor. The movement is used to drive a Theremin instrument constructed in PD ( Pure Data ). Several different PD instruments are here.
